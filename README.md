## **Project Background**
India's electric vehicle (EV) market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (**CAGR**) of **33.25%** between **2024 and 2032**, driven by growing environmental consciousness and increasing affordability through government subsidies. With two-wheelers dominating over **70% of vehicles in India**, E-Ventura seeks to establish a stronghold in the electric scooter market by leveraging its expertise in sustainable mobility solutions.

---

## **Executive Summary**
E-Ventura’s market entry strategy aims to establish the company as a key player in India’s rapidly growing electric two-wheeler (E2W) scooter market. The Indian E2W market, valued at $950.4 million in 2023, is projected to grow at a CAGR of 33.25%, reaching $12,586.69 million by 2032. With scooters dominating the market, particularly in affordable and premium segments, E-Ventura’s Edge (premium) and Flex (mid-range) scooters are well-positioned to capture significant market share. The strategy addresses key consumer pain points, including inadequate charging infrastructure, affordability, and safety. A phased Go-To-Market (GTM) approach includes pre-launch activities like pilot programmes, digital advertising, and partnerships, followed by a launch strategy featuring direct-to-consumer sales, dealership networks, and flagship stores. Post-launch efforts will focus on scaling operations, expanding into Tier-2/3 cities, and introducing subscription services to boost customer retention. The project aims to achieve a 2% market share within the first year, with a total project NPV of ₹183 million and an IRR of 33%. However, it is recommended that E-Ventura targets a market penetration of 2-7% for long-term profitability. Prioritising partnerships with charging providers, launching financing options, and expanding dealership networks are critical to success. Regional marketing campaigns and sustainability-focused initiatives will further enhance brand positioning and consumer trust.
